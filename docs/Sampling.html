<h1>Preliminary considerations</h1>
<p>The sample data is collected to be used for estimating the population
characteristics (ie. level of disease in the field). Since it is only a
sample of that population there is an inherent uncertainty tied to these
estimates. The level of uncertainty can can be controlled by collecting
reliable sample size. A reliable sample size is, in this context, the
one which will provide the similar answer if the sampling is to be
randomly repeated.</p>
<div id="reliability-of-estimated-sample-mean" class="section level2">
<h2>Reliability of estimated sample mean</h2>
<p>A <strong>coefficient of variation</strong>(CV), is a way to measure
how spread out values are in a data set relative to the mean. It is
calculated as:</p>
<p>CV = σ / μ</p>
<p>where: σ: The standard deviation of dataset<br />
μ: The mean of dataset</p>
<p>The coefficient of variation is simply the ratio between the standard
deviation and the mean.</p>

<h2>Simple random sampling based on binomial distribution</h2>
<p>only with finite population correction</p>
<ul>
<li><em>M</em> = population size<br />
</li>
<li><em>CV</em> = Coeficient of variation<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note: * While each function can be used to illustrate
conceptually sample size, it is important to take into account
appropriate knowledge of the pathosystem of interest and conduct pilot
studies or consult the literature to determine appropriate
information</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions are written to basically calculate an initial sample that
is a function of each formula - this estimate number often will be
larger than the defined population size, which is the proportion of the
total often may be larger than 1 (100%). Use caution for basing a sample
size calculation based on the finite correction factor; may also imply
the need to increase the sampling frame</li>

<h2>Cluster sampling for disease incidence</h2>
<p>This code illustrates a situation in which the pattern of disease
incidence at that quadrant scale is random. We will draw a sample from a
binomial distribution that has the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of quadrants = 300 (for our example, this would represent
the population and we will use a sample as a pilot study to illustrate
calculations)</p></li>
<li><p>Probability of success (i.e., disease) = 0.25</p></li>
<li><p>Number of trials per quadrant (plants) = 10</p></li>
</ul>
<p>set.seed(101) enables the reproduction of the example; if desired,
this can be changed to simulate different samples</p>

<h2>Cluster sampling for disease incidence</h2>
<p>This code, when copied and pasted, will duplicate the information
needed to replicate the example in the notes pertaining to cluster
sampling for disease incidence data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of quadrants = 300</li>
<li>Probability of success (i.e., disease) = 0.35</li>
<li>theta $= overdispersion parameter, which is connected to shape1 and
shape2 parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: this distribution is rather flexible and takes on many
different forms depending on the parameters, for our illustration,
emphasis will be placed on generating an over-dispersed example to
illustrate the calculations. Here, prob=0.35 represent the probability a
given plant would be infected, based on Bernoulli trials and
subsequently the beta-distribution</p>

<h1>CLUSTER SAMPLING FOR DISEASE INCIDENCE</h1>
<p>The following section has functions to calculate sample sizes based
on Madden et al. (2007), table 10. Note, for the following, the finite
population is not applied; this could be handled using direct
calculations. Based on known number of sampling units, etc., or code
could be modified accordingly.</p>
<div id="based-on-cv" class="section level2">
<h2>Based on CV</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>mean</em> = mean disease incidence<br />
</li>
<li><em>n</em> = number of individuals per sampling unit</li>
<li><em>CV</em> = coefficient of variation</li>
<li><em>N</em> = number of sampling units (e.g., quadrant) estimated
based on outlined criteria</li>
